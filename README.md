# Internship-Project

As part of this internship, I completed the following tasks:

A pie chart showing the proportion of total clicks for tweets with over 500 impressions, with drill-down functionality.
A clustered bar chart of URL, profile, and hashtag clicks by tweet category, filtered by specific time, date, and word count criteria.
A comparative visualization of replies, retweets, and likes for tweets with media engagements above the median, with additional filters applied.
