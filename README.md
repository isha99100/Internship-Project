# Internship-Project

As part of this internship, I completed the following tasks:

1.A pie chart showing the proportion of total clicks for tweets with over 500 impressions, with drill-down functionality.
2.A clustered bar chart of URL, profile, and hashtag clicks by tweet category, filtered by specific time, date, and word count criteria.
3.A comparative visualization of replies, retweets, and likes for tweets with media engagements above the median, with additional filters applied.
